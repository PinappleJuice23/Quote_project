# Quote_project
Mobile application made for the Android system to help find, post and look through famous
and well-known quotes.
Browsing quotes on the internet is often tedious and cumbersome; forums or websites are
mostly unintuitive and lack the ability to publish one's own quotes. Quotes are useful in
diversifying conversations or even our own thoughts. The aim of the application is to
facilitate users in displaying and exchanging quotes from various sources.
# "Quot√©":
- The application runs on Android systems
- The application connects to a Firebase database
- The application allows posting and browsing of other users' quotes
- The application allows following other users
- The application allows commenting, displaying, and liking posts with quotes

Thanks to a fast and simple system for adding and browsing quotes, users will have easy
access to their favorite quotes. Each user will have the ability to create their own profile and
share quotes, as well as comment and like quotes from other users.
The application will most likely use Firebase and Kotlin.
